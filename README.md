# MipSimulator

•	MISP simulator is written in javascript and deployable within most current web browsers. The package relies on three javascript dependences: Bootstrap, D3, editable tables.
•	The code is be upload to Github: https://github.com/gaby-baby/MipSimulator

Note: in Chrome you many get a cross origin error. This is a security feature of chrome that will block data file from loading on local disk. If you see only a text area, the svg has not loaded due to this restriction. There are many fixes:  1) run simulator from an actual server (such as .www folder in labnet) 2) install a server on local machine. (such as MAMP or script using python)
